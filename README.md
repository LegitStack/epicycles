#Epicycles
This was a project exploring [epicycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferent_and_epicycle#Mathematical_formalism), their properties, and how to compute them in order to draw out a path.

See the demo for a more in-depth explanation of what an epicycle is, why they are interesting, and what you can do with them.

##Code
The core of the math is in `epicycles.js`, the rest is mainly drawing and simulation functionality for the demo. I didn't do the greatest job breaking things into clean abstractions, but it works.

Everything is front-end code, so you can open `demo/index.html` in a browser (with an internet connection to load in 3rd party utilities) and everything shoud Just Workâ„¢.
